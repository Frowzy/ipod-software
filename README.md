The first of these software versions to support the iPod 2nd generation was 1.2, for which it originally shipped with in 2002. The 10GB 1st generation originally shipped with version 1.1, however it can technically run 1.0.4 and 1.0. 

NOTE: It will be limited to only using 5GB of storage as this limitation is hard-coded into these versions.
