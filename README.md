Each branch contains software for that particular device you may be seeking.

## Branch specific details

Not much is known about these firmware files.

They appear to be from the iPod Video "Enhanced" a.k.a.: "5.5th Generation" firmware file, however the speculation whether this is for the iPod Classic, a.k.a.: "6th Generation" remains within the scope of possibility.

We estimate it originated in the period of 2006-2008.

We emplore you to explore and experiment with these files as we (collectively) haven't yet figured out how to do much with them at the present moment.
