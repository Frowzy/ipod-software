# iPod Software Repo

#### This is a community oriented archival project to preserve lost software from classic iPods.

Each branch contains software for that particular device you may be seeking.

WARNING: I offer no guarantee or warranty for any software included. Flash at your own risk. 


## Branch specific details
1.0, 1.0.2 and 1.0.4 will require you to first install the firmware via the iPod Updater 1.0.4, found in the mac-updaters branch, as these versions are also not at all compatible with Windows. 

The first of these software versions to support the iPod Classic 2nd generation was 1.2, that is what it originally shipped with in 2002. The 10gb 1st generation originally shipped with version 1.1, however it can technically run 1.0.4 and 1.0, however it will be limited to only using 5gb of storage as this limitation is hard coded into these versions.

Updating a first generation all the way from 1.0 to 1.5 has a massive tendency to boot loop it, if this happens to you the only fix [that is known] is to remove the hard drive from the iPod, format it in another and then plug it back into the 1st generation.
